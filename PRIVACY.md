# Privacy

OpenVoiceFlow is a native macOS app that runs on your Mac. We wrote this document to be readable in one sitting: no legalese, no "we may collect" clauses that turn out to mean everything. If anything below is unclear or wrong, open a GitHub Discussion and we'll fix it.

This policy applies to OpenVoiceFlow `v0.4.x` (the native macOS app). For the older Python CLI (`v0.3.x` and earlier), check `git log PRIVACY.md` or the corresponding tagged release.

## 1. TL;DR

- **Your audio never leaves your Mac.** Transcription happens on-device via **WhisperKit**. The recording is discarded the moment the transcript exists. There is no audio upload, ever.
- **Cleanup is Off by default.** Out of the box, OpenVoiceFlow pastes the raw on-device transcript with no LLM step and no network call. You have to turn cleanup on yourself.
- **Cloud cleanup is opt-in and bring-your-own-key.** If you enable **OpenRouter** cleanup, only the transcript text (plus your personal context — see below) is sent, under your own key, to a provider you contract with directly. You can instead run **Ollama** locally, or leave cleanup **Off**.
- **OpenVoiceFlow has no servers.** The app itself has no telemetry, no analytics, no crash reporting, no accounts, and no cloud sync. It checks for updates through Sparkle (see §3).
- **Your keys are in the Keychain; your data is on your disk.** API keys are stored in the macOS **Keychain**. Settings, history, and your personal context live locally in the app's **Application Support** folder.

## 2. Data inventory

Everything OpenVoiceFlow knows about you lives in one of the rows below.

| Artifact | Where it lives | What it contains | Default state | Goes off the Mac? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Audio buffers** | RAM only, while you hold the hotkey | Your raw microphone audio | Always on (it's how dictation works) | **No.** Transcribed on-device by WhisperKit, then discarded. Never written to a network. |
| **Cleaned transcripts (Off)** | Nowhere new | The WhisperKit output is pasted directly with no LLM cleanup | **Default** | **No.** No cleanup call is made at all. |
| **Cleaned transcripts (Ollama)** | In transit to `http://localhost:11434` | The transcribed text + your profile / dictionary / snippet context | If you enable Ollama cleanup | **No.** Stays on the Mac (or wherever you point Ollama). |
| **Cleaned transcripts (OpenRouter)** | In transit to `openrouter.ai` | The transcribed text + your profile / dictionary / snippet context | If you enable OpenRouter cleanup | **Yes** — to OpenRouter, under your own key. You contract directly with OpenRouter under its terms. |
| **API keys** | macOS **Keychain** | Your OpenRouter key (if you set one) | Empty until you enable cloud cleanup | **No.** Stored by the system Keychain, not in a settings file. |
| **Settings** | App **Application Support** folder | Hotkey, model choice, cleanup backend choice, feature toggles | Created on first run | **No.** |
| **Know-Me profile** | App Application Support folder | Your name, occupation, industry, people/tools you mention, communication style | Empty until you complete the **Know Me** interview | **No** — but the profile is injected into every cleanup call, so an enabled cloud backend sees it. |
| **Dictionary** | App Application Support folder | Words and aliases you've added | Empty until you add words | **No** — but added words are injected into cleanup calls, like the profile. |
| **Snippets** | App Application Support folder | Voice triggers and their expansions. May contain signature blocks. | Empty until you add snippets | **No** — but expansions become part of dictated text and follow whatever path you've set for that text. |
| **History / stats** | App Application Support folder | Recent dictations and aggregate counters | Local | **No.** Never sent anywhere. |
| **Sparkle update check** | In transit to the appcast host | A request for the update feed to see if a newer signed build exists | On by default | **Yes** — an anonymous request for the update manifest. No PII, no key, no user ID. |

### Data flow for a single dictation

```
  mic audio  ──►  WhisperKit (on-device)  ──►  raw transcript (RAM)
                                                     │
                                                     ▼
                                     voice-command replacement (local)
                                                     │
                                                     ▼
        profile + dictionary + selected text  ──►  cleanup backend
                                                     │
                                      ┌──────────────┼───────────────┐
                                      ▼              ▼               ▼
                                     Off          Ollama         OpenRouter
                                  (no call)      (local)         (cloud, BYO key)
                                                     │
                                                     ▼
                                          cleaned text  ──►  paste at cursor
```

With cleanup **Off** (the default) or set to **Ollama**, no byte of your dictation crosses the machine boundary. The only baseline network egress is the Sparkle update check.

## 3. Sub-processors — who else sees your data

OpenVoiceFlow itself is **not** a sub-processor of your data. We have no servers, no database, no logs, and no copy of anything you dictate. When you point the app at a cloud LLM, you are contracting directly with that provider under their terms; we are not in the middle.

The third parties your install can talk to:

- **OpenRouter** (`openrouter.ai`) — the recommended cloud gateway. **Only if** you enable OpenRouter cleanup, it receives your transcript plus your profile / dictionary / snippet context every time you dictate. One OpenRouter key reaches any model it hosts (you pick the model in the app). Governed by OpenRouter's terms.
- **Other cloud providers** — some builds also let you point cleanup directly at Anthropic, OpenAI, or Groq instead of OpenRouter. Whichever provider you select is the one that receives your transcript + context, under your own API key. OpenRouter is the recommended path.
- **Ollama** (`http://localhost:11434` by default) — runs on your machine. No third party.
- **Off** — no cleanup call. The raw WhisperKit output is pasted without cleanup.
- **WhisperKit model download** (`huggingface.co`) — used **once**, during first-run onboarding, to download the on-device speech model. No account required, no PII sent. After that, the model is on disk and never re-fetched unless you change models.
- **Sparkle updates** — the app checks a signed appcast for newer builds and can download and install them in place. The request is anonymous (no auth, no key, no user ID); updates are Developer-ID-signed and verified before install.

Cleanup is **Off by default** — the raw on-device transcript is pasted as-is and nothing leaves your Mac. A cloud provider only ever receives text if you turn cleanup on and select one.

## 4. Permissions you grant macOS

OpenVoiceFlow asks macOS for these privileges. You grant them in **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, and you can revoke them at any time.

- **Microphone** — to capture audio while you hold the hotkey. Required for dictation.
- **Accessibility** — to paste the cleaned text into the focused text field (a synthetic ⌘V). The app does not read your screen or the contents of other apps.
- **Input Monitoring** — to detect the global push-to-talk hotkey in every app.

---

## 5. Defaults you can change

Every privacy-relevant default is a toggle in the app's menu-bar settings. There is no CLI to configure.

| Setting | Default | What it controls |
|---|---|---|
| **Cleanup backend** | **Off** | Whether — and how — your transcript is cleaned up. Off = raw local transcript; Ollama = local model; OpenRouter (or OpenAI / Anthropic / Groq) = cloud cleanup with your key. |
| **Auto-learn** | **off** | Reads the focused text field briefly post-paste to learn corrections. |
| **Voice commands** | on | Replaces spoken punctuation phrases ("new line", "comma") locally, before any cleanup call. |
| **Update check (Sparkle)** | on | Checks the signed appcast for a newer build. |

Because cleanup ships **Off**, a fresh install does nothing over the network at runtime except the Sparkle update check — and your audio and text stay on the Mac regardless.

## 6. What the app doesn't do

- **No in-app telemetry.** The app does not collect usage data, feature usage, dictation counts, or error rates. Nothing about how you use the app is sent anywhere. (The **website** uses privacy-friendly analytics — see §7.)
- **No crash reports from the app.** macOS may keep a system-level crash log under `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/`; that's Apple's, not ours.
- **No shared keys.** OpenVoiceFlow ships with no embedded API keys. You bring your own, and it lives in your Keychain.
- **No cloud sync.** Your settings and profile do not sync across machines.
- **No accounts.** There is no sign-up, no login, no email collected.
- **No third-party analytics or tracking SDKs** inside the app.

Anything you've already sent to OpenRouter lives by that provider's retention policy — delete it through their account or API.

## 7. This website

The download site (`openvoiceflow.vercel.app`) uses **Vercel Analytics**, a privacy-friendly measurement product, to count anonymous page views and download/install-guide events. It sets no advertising cookies, builds no cross-site profile, and does not link a visit to an individual. This is **website** measurement only and is separate from the app, which contains no analytics. Vercel's analytics privacy notice: <https://vercel.com/docs/analytics/privacy-policy>.

## 8. GDPR posture

OpenVoiceFlow is a **bring-your-own-key (BYOK), self-managed, personal-productivity tool**. Practically:

- **OpenVoiceFlow is not a controller or processor** of your dictation data under GDPR. We don't run servers and we have no copy of anything you dictate, store, or configure.
- **You are the controller** of the data on your Mac. You decide whether to fill out the Know Me interview and whether to enable cloud cleanup.
- **If you enable OpenRouter cleanup, OpenRouter is an independent controller / processor** for the text you send it. If you need a Data Processing Addendum (DPA), Standard Contractual Clauses, or any other GDPR paperwork, you negotiate that **directly with OpenRouter** under your own account. OpenVoiceFlow cannot sign a DPA on their behalf and does not pretend to.
- **EU users:** if your dictations contain personal data and you enable cloud cleanup, you are responsible for the lawful basis and the international-transfer story. The simplest way to take every cloud provider out of the picture is to leave cleanup **Off** or use **Ollama**.
- **Regulated industries (healthcare, legal, financial, government):** OpenVoiceFlow has no SOC 2, no ISO 27001, no HIPAA BAA, and no FedRAMP. Don't use it for regulated data unless you have your own compliance overlay (your own DPA with OpenRouter, your own air-gapped Ollama deployment, your own organizational controls).

## 9. Children's privacy / COPPA

OpenVoiceFlow is not designed for, and not directed to, children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from anyone (kids included), but we also don't perform any age verification. If a child under 13 is using your Mac and dictating through cloud cleanup, the LLM provider's children's-privacy policy applies, not ours.

## 10. Changes to this policy

This file is versioned alongside the code. Material changes get a line in `CHANGELOG.md` under the release that introduces them, and the diff is visible in `git log PRIVACY.md`. There is no email list, no banner, no "we've updated our privacy policy" pop-up — if you want to track changes, watch the repo or read the changelog when you upgrade.

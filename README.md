## Why OpenVoiceFlow?

Other tools ask you to pay $144/year and trust their cloud. We don't.

| | Annual Cost | Source Access | Local Audio | Learns From You | Per-App Styles |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **OpenVoiceFlow** | **$0-3** | Private beta; MIT planned | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Wispr Flow | $144 | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Superwhisper | $85 | ❌ | ✅ | Partial | ✅ |
| VoiceInk | Free (GPL) | ❌ PRs | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |

**Privacy at a glance:**
- 🎤 **Audio** stays on your Mac. Always. Whisper.cpp runs locally with Metal GPU.
- 📝 **Cleaned transcripts** go to the LLM provider you pick (OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq) — *or stay on your Mac if you pick Ollama or "no cleanup"*.
- 🔑 **API keys** live in `~/.openvoiceflow/config.json`, mode `600` (owner-only).
- 📓 **Daily transcript logs** are off by default; opt in via `--log-transcripts on` if you want a searchable diary.
- 🧠 **Auto-learn** is off by default; the Know Me interview asks before turning it on.

Your wallet stays full. Your corrections teach the app. You decide what data leaves your Mac.

## How It Works

```
  🎤  "um hey can you schedule a meeting for uh Thursday no wait Friday"
                                    ↓
  🔊  Whisper — transcribes locally on your Mac (Metal GPU accelerated)
                                    ↓
  🗣️  Voice Commands — "new line", "period", "comma" replaced instantly
                                    ↓
  🧠  LLM Cleanup — removes fillers, handles "no wait", fixes grammar
                                    ↓
  📋  "Hey, can you schedule a meeting for Friday?"
                                    ↓
  ⌨️  Auto-paste — text appears at your cursor in any app
```

**Real-time streaming.** Words appear in the overlay as you speak, not after you stop. Powered by `whisper-stream`.

**Context-aware.** OpenVoiceFlow reads the app you're in, the text you have selected, and your personal profile to produce text that fits perfectly.

## Get Started in 60 Seconds

### Download the App

Public users should download OpenVoiceFlow from the website, not from GitHub. The repository is private during this launch phase, so GitHub release/source URLs can 404 for unauthenticated visitors.

- **Download page:** <https://openvoiceflow.vercel.app/download.html>
- **Apple Silicon DMG:** <https://openvoiceflow.vercel.app/downloads/OpenVoiceFlow-0.3.0-arm64.dmg>
- **Intel DMG:** <https://openvoiceflow.vercel.app/downloads/OpenVoiceFlow-0.3.0-x86_64.dmg>

Open the website-hosted DMG, drag OpenVoiceFlow to Applications, then launch it.

> First launch installs everything automatically, walks you through setup, and interviews you so it knows your name, your team, and your jargon from day one.

<details>
<summary><strong>Source install for collaborators</strong></summary>

<br/>

Source install currently requires collaborator access to the private GitHub repository. Public website visitors should use the website-hosted DMG downloads above.

**One-line install:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shimoverse/openvoiceflow.git && cd openvoiceflow && bash install.sh
```

**Manual setup:**
```bash
brew install whisper-cpp
git clone https://github.com/shimoverse/openvoiceflow.git && cd openvoiceflow
python3 -m venv ~/.openvoiceflow/venv
~/.openvoiceflow/venv/bin/pip install -e ".[all]"
openvoiceflow --set-key openrouter YOUR_KEY_HERE
openvoiceflow
```

## Features

<br/>

### 🎙️ Real-Time Streaming

Words appear in the floating overlay **as you speak**. No waiting until you release the key.

Powered by `whisper-stream` (Metal-accelerated on Apple Silicon). Samples audio every 3 seconds, transcribes continuously, shows partial results live. Falls back to batch mode on Intel if needed.

```bash
openvoiceflow --streaming on     # default
openvoiceflow --streaming off    # classic batch mode
```

---

### 🪟 Native Floating Overlay

A macOS HUD pill floats at the bottom of your screen. Always visible, never in the way.

| State | What You See |
|:------|:-------------|
| 🔴 Recording | Red indicator while you speak |
| 🎙 Streaming | Live text appearing as you talk |
| ⏳ Processing | Animated dots during LLM cleanup |
| ✅ Done | Brief flash of the cleaned text |
| 📚 Learned | "mir → Meer" when auto-learn detects a correction |
| ❌ Error | Clear error message with guidance |

Built with PyObjC/AppKit. Works across all Spaces and fullscreen apps.

---

### 🧠 Know Me — Smart Profile Onboarding

**No other dictation app does this.** On first launch, OpenVoiceFlow interviews you:

1. **What's your name?** — So it's always spelled right
2. **What do you do?** — Your role and industry seed the vocabulary
3. **Who do you mention?** — Work names, home names, brands, tools
4. **How do you communicate?** — Casual, balanced, or formal

60 seconds. The very first dictation after setup nails your kid's name, your coworker's name, and your company jargon. All names auto-populate the dictionary too.

```bash
openvoiceflow --profile          # re-run the interview anytime
openvoiceflow --show-profile     # see what it knows
openvoiceflow --clear-profile    # start fresh
```

---

### 📚 Auto-Learn From Corrections

You dictate "picking up mir from school." You fix "mir" to "Meer." OpenVoiceFlow silently learns.

- Watches the text field for 30 seconds after each paste (5s, 10s, 15s, 20s, 30s)
- Detects word-level substitutions via macOS Accessibility API
- Adds corrections to your dictionary automatically
- Shows a subtle "📚 mir → Meer" notification in the overlay
- Stops watching if you switch apps

**You never open settings. You never type `--add-word`. You just fix a typo once, and it learns forever.**

```bash
openvoiceflow --auto-learn on    # opt in to correction learning
openvoiceflow --auto-learn off   # fresh-install default
```

---

### 🎯 Per-App Context Detection

OpenVoiceFlow reads which app you're in and adapts automatically.

| App | Auto Style | What Changes |
|:----|:-----------|:-------------|
| VS Code, Xcode, Terminal, iTerm2 | `code` | Preserves technical terms, function names |
| Gmail, Outlook, Mail, Superhuman | `email` | Professional structure, greeting/closing |
| Slack, Discord, WhatsApp, iMessage | `casual` | Friendly tone, contractions |
| Word, Notion, Google Docs | `default` | Natural, balanced |

30 apps mapped out of the box. Add your own:

```bash
openvoiceflow --app-style "Figma" formal
openvoiceflow --list-app-styles
```

---

### 📎 Selected Text Context

Have text selected when you start dictating? OpenVoiceFlow reads it and feeds it to the LLM.

**Reply to an email:** Select the email text, hold your hotkey, speak your reply. The LLM understands what you're replying to and formats accordingly.

**Edit a paragraph:** Select it, dictate your revision. The AI knows what you're editing.

```bash
# enabled by default, toggle in config:
# "selected_text_context": true
```

---

### 🗣️ Voice Commands

Say punctuation and formatting commands naturally. They're replaced **before** the LLM sees the text, so there's zero added latency.

**24 default commands** — say any of the trigger phrases below and OpenVoiceFlow swaps it in instantly:

| Say | Get |
|:----|:----|
| "new line" / "newline" | ↵ |
| "new paragraph" | ↵↵ |
| "period" / "full stop" | . |
| "comma" | , |
| "question mark" | ? |
| "exclamation mark" / "exclamation point" | ! |
| "colon" | : |
| "semicolon" | ; |
| "open paren" / "open parenthesis" | ( |
| "close paren" / "close parenthesis" | ) |
| "open quote" / "open quotes" | " |
| "close quote" / "close quotes" | " |
| "ellipsis" / "dot dot dot" | ... |
| "dash" / "hyphen" | - |
| "tab" | ⇥ |

Run `openvoiceflow --list-commands` to print the live table from your installed version.

Add custom commands:

```bash
openvoiceflow --add-command "smiley face" "😊"
openvoiceflow --list-commands
```

---

### 📖 Personal Dictionary

Teach OpenVoiceFlow words it should always spell correctly.

```bash
openvoiceflow --add-word "OpenVoiceFlow"
openvoiceflow --add-word "Kubernetes"
openvoiceflow --list-words
```

Words are injected into the LLM prompt so names, brands, and jargon always come out right. Auto-populated by the Know Me interview and auto-learn.

---

### 📌 Voice Snippets

Say a phrase. Get a paragraph.

```bash
openvoiceflow --add-snippet "insert signature" "Best regards,
Shimoverse
alex@example.com"

openvoiceflow --add-snippet "my address" "742 Evergreen Terrace, Springfield"
```

Snippets expand instantly. No LLM call needed.

---

### 🎨 Tone & Style Modes

| Style | Tone | Use In |
|:------|:-----|:-------|
| `default` | Natural, balanced | Anywhere |
| `casual` | Friendly, contractions OK | Slack, iMessage |
| `formal` | Professional, no contractions | Reports, proposals |
| `code` | Preserves technical terms | IDEs, commit messages |
| `email` | Proper structure | Gmail, Outlook |

```bash
openvoiceflow --style casual
```

Automatically set by per-app context detection, or choose manually.

---

Dictate in any language Whisper supports.

```bash
openvoiceflow --language es      # Spanish

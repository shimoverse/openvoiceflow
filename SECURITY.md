# Security Policy

OpenVoiceFlow is a free, open-source macOS voice-dictation app. This document explains
which versions get security fixes, how to report a vulnerability, what to expect from us,
and what is in scope.

This is a **single-maintainer project**. Response is best-effort, on a human schedule. We
do **not** offer an SLA, and the project is **not** SOC 2 / ISO 27001 / HIPAA certified.
If your organization requires those, OpenVoiceFlow is probably not the right fit.

---

## Supported versions

Only the current minor line gets security fixes. Older lines are frozen at their last
release.

| Version | Supported          | Notes                                      |
|---------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 0.3.x   | ✅ Yes             | Current line. All security fixes land here.|
| 0.2.x   | ❌ No              | Frozen at 0.2.0. Upgrade to 0.3.x.         |
| 0.1.x   | ❌ No              | Frozen. Upgrade to 0.3.x.                  |

When 0.4.x ships, 0.3.x moves to unsupported. We do not backport.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open a public GitHub issue for security problems.**

### Preferred: GitHub private security advisory

Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting:

> https://github.com/shimoverse/openvoiceflow/security/advisories/new

This goes to the maintainer privately, lets us collaborate on a fix in a private fork,
and is the easiest path to a CVE if one is warranted.

### If you can't use GitHub advisories

GitHub private vulnerability reporting is currently the only private channel.
If you have no GitHub account (or policy forbids it), open a plain GitHub issue
that says only "security report — please open a private channel" with **no
technical details**, and the maintainer will follow up. A dedicated security
email (with PGP key) will be published here if one is established.

### What to include

The more of this we have, the faster we can act:

- Affected version (`openvoiceflow --version`).
- macOS version and chip (Apple Silicon vs. Intel).
- A clear description of the issue and the impact you believe it has.
- Steps to reproduce, or a proof-of-concept.
- Any logs, stack traces, or screenshots that help.
- Whether you'd like credit in the release notes, and under what name/handle.

## Disclosure expectations

| Stage                     | Target                                                    |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Acknowledgement           | Within **5 business days** of receipt.                    |
| Triage + initial assessment | Within **10 business days**.                            |
| Fix + coordinated disclosure window | **90 days** from the report, unless we agree otherwise. |
| CVE                       | We'll request one via GitHub if the issue is accepted and warrants it. |
| Credit                    | In the release notes for the fix, if you'd like it.       |

If we can't meet these targets (single-maintainer realities), we'll tell you and propose
a new timeline rather than go silent.

We ask, in return:

- Don't publicly disclose before the fix ships, or before the 90 days are up — whichever
  comes first.
- Don't pivot a vulnerability into actual user harm (no exfiltrating other users' data,
  no running the issue against users who haven't consented).
- Good-faith research is welcome and won't be met with legal threats.

No bug bounty. We can't pay; the project earns $0.

## What's in scope

- The `voiceflow` Python package (everything under `voiceflow/`).
- `install.sh` — the curl-pipe installer.
- `build-dmg.sh` — the DMG build script.
- The DMG bundle launcher (`OpenVoiceFlow.app`'s shipped entry point).
- The GitHub Actions workflows under `.github/workflows/` (release, CI, smoke tests).

Typical in-scope issues: path traversal or command injection in any of the above; a
config or env var that lets a local attacker escalate privileges or read another
user's files; API keys / transcripts / profile data ending up world-readable, leaked
over the network, or shipped somewhere we don't document; a compromised release
pipeline; a malicious LLM response or clipboard payload escaping its intended
boundary (arbitrary code execution rather than just bad text).

## What's out of scope

These are real concerns, but **not** ours to fix — please report them upstream:

- **Third-party LLM providers** (OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, Ollama). Report to
  the provider. We just send HTTPS requests to their published APIs.
- **whisper.cpp / ggml / whisper-stream.** Report upstream at
  https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp.
- **Homebrew** and packages it installs. Report to Homebrew or the package's upstream.
- **macOS itself** — kernel issues, Accessibility-API bypasses at the OS level, code
  signing infrastructure, Keychain. Report to Apple.
- **Your own LLM prompts.** `llm_prompt` is config-controlled; a hostile prompt is a
  config-tampering risk against yourself, not a vendor bug. Self-jailbreak is between
  you and your LLM.

If you're not sure, send it anyway and we'll route it.

## Threat model

A short pointer, not a full document. The full version lives at
[`docs/THREAT_MODEL.md`](docs/THREAT_MODEL.md).

OpenVoiceFlow holds three strong privileges on the user's Mac:

1. **Microphone access** — to capture audio for whisper.cpp.
2. **Accessibility API** — to paste cleaned text at the cursor and (when enabled) to
   read the focused text field for ~30 seconds after a paste so the auto-learner can
   notice user corrections.
3. **Apple Events** — to detect the frontmost app for per-app context.

Together those mean a compromise of OpenVoiceFlow is roughly equivalent to a
compromise of the user's interactive desktop session. The threat model documents how
we limit blast radius (local-only audio, default-off transcript logging, default-off
auto-learner, mode-600 config files, no telemetry) and what we explicitly don't
defend against (a malicious operator who already has shell access as the user; a user
who configures a hostile `llm_prompt`; supply-chain compromise of a chosen LLM
provider).

---

## Data minimization defaults

A v0.3.0 fresh install ships with:

- `log_transcripts: false` — no daily JSONL/MD transcript logs are written.
- `auto_learn: false` — the Accessibility-API correction watcher is dormant until you
  opt in via the Know Me interview.
- `~/.openvoiceflow/*.json` — written with mode `600` (owner read/write only).
- **No telemetry, ever.** No usage pings, no crash reports, no install beacons.
- `update_check: true` — the only outbound request we make on your behalf, hitting
  `https://api.github.com/repos/shimoverse/openvoiceflow/releases/latest` once per
  launch. Set `update_check: false` in `~/.openvoiceflow/config.json` to disable.

Everything else — sending cleaned transcripts to a cloud LLM, indexing daily logs with
`--search`, etc. — is opt-in or follows from a configuration choice the user made.

The README's "Privacy at a glance" panel is the authoritative summary; this section
exists so a security reviewer doesn't have to take a marketing page at face value.

## CVE history

No advisories yet.

When we have one, it'll be linked here, in the relevant `CHANGELOG.md` entry, and as a
GitHub Security Advisory on the repo.

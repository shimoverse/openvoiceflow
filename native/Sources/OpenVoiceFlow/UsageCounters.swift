/// This is the in-app half of the website's page/CTA analytics: it answers
/// which panes people open and which features they actually reach for, so a
/// feature nobody opens can be found without guessing. It deliberately cannot
/// answer anything else.
///
/// The shape is the point. A counter is a name and a number — `pane.history`,
/// 42. There is no event log, no timestamps, no ordering, and no payload, so
/// there is nothing here that could reconstruct a session, and nothing that
/// could contain dictated text, a snippet, a dictionary entry, or a profile
/// even by accident: the names are compile-time constants in `Event`, and
/// `record` takes one of those, never a caller-supplied string.
///
/// Counters live in Application Support like every other local store and are
/// only ever transmitted by `AnalyticsClient`, under the same Settings ▸
/// Privacy ▸ "Share anonymous usage & leaderboard rank" switch as the rest of
/// the payload. Off means they stay on the Mac; they are still counted, so the
/// Home pane can show local usage without asking the network anything.

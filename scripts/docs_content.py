        <ul>
          <li><strong>macOS only.</strong> macOS 14 (Sonoma) or newer, Apple Silicon and Intel. There is no Windows or Linux build. iOS and Android are in development and cannot be downloaded today.</li>
          <li><strong>No spoken punctuation commands.</strong> Saying &ldquo;comma&rdquo; types the word &ldquo;comma&rdquo;. Whisper punctuates from sentence structure on its own, and <a href="ai-cleanup.html">AI cleanup</a> handles the rest if you turn it on.</li>
          <li><strong>No meeting recording, no cloud sync, no accounts.</strong> There is no server your dictation history syncs to.</li>
          <li><strong>Dictation itself is never reported anywhere.</strong> As of 0.5.7, an opt-out anonymous usage summary (word/time totals, which features you use, a display name you choose) powers an in-app leaderboard — never audio, never dictated text.

        <p>All three are macOS-level grants. macOS holds the keys, not the app: you can inspect or revoke any of them at any time in System Settings, and the app has no way to grant itself anything.</p>

        <h2 id="granting">Granting them</h2>
        <p>First-run onboarding asks in order — Microphone, then Accessibility, then Input Monitoring — and unlocks each row only when the previous one is granted. That ordering is deliberate: it keeps three simultaneous system dialogs from stacking up on top of each other.</p>
        <p>You can also grant or re-check them later from <strong>Dashboard ▸ Settings ▸ Permissions</strong>, which shows each one as granted, or offers a <strong>Grant…</strong> button, or an <strong>Open System Settings</strong> button when a permission was previously denied.</p>

        <div class="callout warn">
          <span class="callout-label">Clicked Allow and nothing happened?</span>
          <p>This is the most common permissions snag, and it is usually Accessibility or Input Monitoring. macOS sometimes shows the prompt but does not add the app to the list. The fix: open the relevant pane in <strong>System Settings ▸ Privacy &amp; Security</strong>, click <strong>+</strong>, and pick <strong>OpenVoiceFlow</strong> from your Applications folder. The app watches for the change and picks it up within about a second — no relaunch needed.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="checking">Checking them by hand</h2>
        <p>Open <strong>System Settings ▸ Privacy &amp; Security</strong> and look in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Microphone</strong> — OpenVoiceFlow should be on.</li>
          <li><strong>Accessibility</strong> — OpenVoiceFlow should be on.</li>
          <li><strong>Input Monitoring</strong> — OpenVoiceFlow should be on.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If a toggle is present but off, turning it on is enough. If the app is missing from a list entirely, add it with <strong>+</strong>.</p>

        <div class="callout tip">
          <span class="callout-label">After a macOS update or an app move</span>
          <p>macOS ties these grants to the app's code signature and location. Moving the app out of <code>/Applications</code>, or restoring it from a backup, can invalidate a grant. If dictation suddenly stops after an update, re-checking these three panes is the first thing to try.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="notgranted">What is never asked for</h2>
        <p>OpenVoiceFlow does not request Screen Recording, Full Disk Access, Automation, Contacts, Calendar, or Photos. It is not sandboxed, but its entitlements request only two capabilities: audio input, and outbound network access used solely for model downloads, update checks, and — if you turn it on — <a href="ai-cleanup.html">cloud cleanup</a>.</p>

          <li><strong>Hold the key</strong> (<kbd>fn</kbd> by default) and speak normally.</li>
          <li><strong>Release.</strong> The app transcribes on your Mac and inserts the text at your cursor.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Because the microphone is live only while the key is down, there is no timeout to race and no mode to remember exiting. Pause mid-sentence to think for as long as you like; the app is still listening as long as you are still holding.</p>

        <h2 id="hud">Reading the HUD</h2>
        <p>A small floating pill appears while you dictate. Its states, in order:</p>

          <tbody>

          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>Errors surface here too, each with a one-tap action: <strong>No microphone</strong> (opens Sound settings), <strong>Took too long — audio kept</strong> (retry), and <strong>Copied instead — press ⌘V</strong> (see <a href="text-insertion.html">How text is inserted</a>).</p>

        <h2 id="limits">Length limits</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Minimum:</strong> about half a second. Anything shorter is treated as a mis-tap and discarded — the HUD says so rather than pasting noise.</li>
          <li><strong>Maximum:</strong> five minutes per take by default, adjustable to 1, 2, 5, or 10 minutes in Settings. When the cap is reached the app <em>finishes the take and inserts it</em> — your audio is never thrown away. The cap exists so a key that gets stuck down can't record forever.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The HUD counts down toward the cap while you hold, so a long take never ends as a surprise.</p>

        <h2 id="pausing">Pausing</h2>
        <p>The menu-bar menu has <strong>Pause for 1 hour</strong>, which stops the app from responding to the hotkey — useful when you are handing your Mac to someone, or when the key you chose is needed for something else. The menu-bar icon shows the paused state, and you can resume from the same menu at any time.</p>

        <div class="callout tip">
          <span class="callout-label">Speak in phrases, not words</span>
          <p>Whisper uses surrounding context to choose between homophones, so dictating a whole clause at natural speed is markedly more accurate than word-by-word delivery. More in <a href="accuracy.html">Improving accuracy</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="punctuation">Punctuation</h2>
        <p>Whisper adds punctuation from sentence structure — you generally do not need to do anything. Note that OpenVoiceFlow 0.5.16 has <strong>no spoken-punctuation commands</strong>: saying &ldquo;comma&rdquo; produces the word &ldquo;comma&rdquo;, not the mark.

        <p>Only modifier and function keys are offered, deliberately: the key you hold to talk should never be a key you also need to type.</p>

        <h2 id="changing">Changing the key</h2>
        <p>Either from the <strong>menu-bar menu ▸ Hotkey</strong>, or in <strong>Dashboard ▸ Settings ▸ Dictation ▸ Hotkey</strong>. The change takes effect immediately — there is nothing to restart.</p>
        <p>For the first week after a change the HUD shows a small reminder chip naming the key, then stops. Changing the key restarts that week, because a new key has to be learned all over again.</p>

        <h2 id="fn">The fn / Globe conflict</h2>
        <p>By default, macOS assigns its own behaviour to <kbd>fn</kbd> — usually opening the emoji picker or starting Apple's own dictation. If pressing it does something unexpected:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Open <strong>System Settings ▸ Keyboard</strong>.</li>
          <li>Set <strong>Press 🌐 to</strong> → <strong>Do Nothing</strong>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Onboarding offers a direct button to that settings pane when <kbd>fn</kbd> is your chosen key. Alternatively, just pick a different hotkey — <kbd>Right ⌘</kbd> is the most common second choice.</p>

        <div class="callout warn">
          <span class="callout-label">If the key does nothing at all</span>
          <p>A hotkey that never fires is almost always missing <strong>Input Monitoring</strong> permission rather than a key conflict. Check <a href="permissions.html">Permissions</a> first, then look for another app holding the same key globally (Raycast, Alfred, Karabiner and similar tools can claim modifiers).</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="other">Other shortcuts</h2>
        <p>Inside the dashboard, <kbd>⌘⇧D</kbd> opens the dashboard window from anywhere in the app. Dictation itself has no other shortcuts — the design goal is one key that behaves identically in every app.</p>

    "lede": "The last step of every dictation is putting the text where your cursor is. It is worth understanding, because it is the step that touches your clipboard.",
    "body": """
        <h2 id="how">What happens on release</h2>
        <p>Once the text is ready, OpenVoiceFlow:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Saves your clipboard</strong> — every item and every format currently on it, not just plain text.</li>
          <li><strong>Puts the dictated text on the clipboard</strong> and synthesizes a <kbd>⌘V</kbd> keystroke into the frontmost app.</li>
          <li><strong>Restores your original clipboard</strong> a fraction of a second later.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The net effect is that text appears at your cursor and whatever you had copied before is still there afterward. That restore step is the reason dictating does not quietly destroy the URL or image you were about to paste.</p>

        <div class="callout">
          <span class="callout-label">Why paste rather than type</span>
          <p>Synthesizing a paste inserts the whole passage at once, correctly, in any app. Synthesizing individual keystrokes would be slower, would break on non-ASCII characters, and would interleave badly with autocomplete. The trade-off is that this route needs Accessibility permission and briefly uses the clipboard.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="blocked">When pasting is blocked</h2>
        <p>If Accessibility permission is missing or has been revoked, the app cannot press <kbd>⌘V</kbd> for you. Rather than losing your words, it deliberately <strong>leaves the dictated text on your clipboard</strong> and the HUD says <strong>Copied instead — press ⌘V</strong>, with a button that takes you to the permission.</p>
        <p>So a failed paste is never a lost dictation: your text is one manual paste away. Fix the permission and the next take inserts normally.</p>

        <h2 id="autopaste">Turning auto-paste off</h2>
        <p><strong>Dashboard ▸ Settings ▸ Dictation ▸ Paste automatically</strong> controls this. With it off, OpenVoiceFlow transcribes and shows you the result but does not press <kbd>⌘V</kbd> and does not touch your clipboard at all.</p>
        <p>People turn this off when they want to review before inserting, or when working in an app where an unexpected paste would be disruptive.</p>

        <h2 id="echo">What the HUD shows afterward</h2>
        <p>By default the HUD briefly echoes the tail of what was inserted, so you can confirm it landed correctly without switching windows. If you dictate sensitive material — passwords, medical notes — turn off <strong>Show what was typed in the HUD</strong> in Settings and the HUD shows a word count instead.</p>

        <h2 id="apps">App compatibility</h2>
        <p>Anywhere with a text cursor works: Mail, Slack, Safari, Chrome, Notes, Word, Notion, VS Code, Xcode, Terminal, iTerm. If a particular app refuses pasted text, that app is usually intercepting <kbd>⌘V</kbd> itself; turning off auto-paste and pasting manually is the reliable workaround.</p>

    "body": """
        <h2 id="pipeline">The pipeline</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Capture.</strong> While the key is held, audio is recorded at 16 kHz mono directly into memory. Nothing is written to disk.</li>
          <li><strong>Transcribe.</strong> On release, the buffer is passed to Whisper running locally through <a href="models.html">WhisperKit</a>, which uses your Mac's Neural Engine and GPU. The audio is discarded once text exists.</li>
          <li><strong>Expand snippets.</strong> If what you said matches a <a href="snippets.html">snippet trigger</a> exactly, the expansion is inserted immediately and the remaining steps are skipped.</li>
          <li><strong>Clean up (optional).</strong> Only if you have enabled <a href="ai-cleanup.html">AI cleanup</a>. This is the one stage that can involve a network, and only the <em>text</em> is ever sent.</li>
          <li><strong>Insert.</strong> The result is placed at your cursor — see <a href="text-insertion.html">How text is inserted</a>.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="live">Live partial transcripts</h2>
        <p>While you hold the key, the app re-transcribes the growing buffer roughly three times a second so words appear in the HUD as you speak. This is a preview, not the final answer: the real pass runs on the complete recording after you release, and it is the one that gets inserted. Seeing partials that later change slightly is normal and expected — the full recording gives Whisper more context to work with.</p>
        <p>Partials cost a little extra compute. If you are on an older Mac and want maximum battery life, turn off <strong>Show words as you speak</strong> in Settings.</p>

        <p>With cleanup off — the default — dictation works in airplane mode indefinitely.</p>

        <h2 id="quality">Why results vary</h2>
        <p>Whisper predicts the most likely word sequence given the audio and its training. That explains most of what you will observe: it is excellent on ordinary prose, good with accents on larger models, and unreliable on proper nouns it has never seen. The fix for names is not a bigger model but the <a href="dictionary.html">personal dictionary</a>.</p>
        <div class="callout">
          <span class="callout-label">A known Whisper quirk</span>
          <p>On near-silent or very short audio, Whisper models occasionally emit a stock phrase such as &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; or &ldquo;Thanks for watching&rdquo; — an artifact of the subtitled video in their training data. Push-to-talk avoids most of it, since you hold the key only while speaking. If you see it, that is the model, not a fault in your setup.</p>

        <p>During onboarding one option carries a <strong>RECOMMENDED</strong> chip, picked from your actual hardware: Large turbo if you are on Apple Silicon with more than about 5 GB free, otherwise Small. That heuristic is a good default — the sections below cover when to override it.</p>

        <h3>When to go bigger</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>You dictate in a <a href="languages.html">language other than English</a> — model size matters most here.</li>
          <li>You have an accent the smaller models handle poorly.</li>
          <li>You dictate in rooms with background noise or at a distance from the mic.</li>
          <li>Your work is full of technical vocabulary.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>When to go smaller</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>You are on an Intel Mac, where there is no Neural Engine to lean on.</li>
          <li>Your Mac has 8 GB of memory and is already under pressure.</li>
          <li>You want the shortest possible delay between releasing the key and seeing text.</li>
          <li>Disk space is tight.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout tip">
          <span class="callout-label">The thirty-second test</span>
          <p>Dictate one real paragraph of your actual work — your jargon, your names, your speaking pace — on the recommended model. Then switch one size and dictate it again. Keep whichever you would forgive being slower. Accuracy you cannot feel is not worth latency you can.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="changing">Changing your model</h2>
        <p>Go to <strong>Dashboard ▸ Settings ▸ Transcription — on this Mac ▸ Whisper model</strong> and pick one. If it has not been downloaded before, the download begins immediately; models you have used before are already on disk and switch instantly.</p>

        <h2 id="downloads">Downloads and storage</h2>
        <p>Models download once and are cached at <code>~/Documents/huggingface/models/argmaxinc/whisperkit-coreml/</code>. The progress display shows transferred size, current speed, and a time estimate.</p>
        <p>Two behaviours worth knowing:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The bar reaching the top does <strong>not</strong> mean it is done. The transfer occupies most of the bar, then macOS compiles the model for your Mac — labelled &ldquo;now optimizing for your Mac. First run only.&rdquo;</li>
          <li>Switching engines mid-download cancels the transfer in progress rather than running two at once.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="failures">If a download fails</h2>
        <p>The app retries once automatically, deleting the partial files first — a truncated download is the usual cause of a model that will not load. If the second attempt also fails, the screen shows <strong>Try again</strong> plus a <strong>Details</strong> disclosure with the underlying error.</p>
        <p>The app deliberately does not guess at causes. If Details mentions the network, check your connection or VPN; if it mentions disk space, free some and retry. Manual recovery: quit the app, delete the model folder above, relaunch, and select the model again.</p>

        <div class="callout warn">
          <span class="callout-label">If you upgraded from 0.5.2</span>
          <p>Version 0.5.2 briefly offered a model id that did not exist, leaving affected installs unable to download anything. Current versions rewrite that stored value automatically on launch — you do not need to do anything, but if you were stuck on 0.5.2, updating is the fix.</p>

        <p>That's every language in Whisper's standard 99-language set. (Large turbo also recognizes Cantonese under the hood, but that language token doesn't exist in Tiny, Small, or Medium's vocabulary, so it's left out of the shared picker above.)</p>

        <div class="callout warn">
          <span class="callout-label">Pair the language with a multilingual model</span>
          <p>Whisper ships both multilingual models and English-only variants (their ids end in <code>.en</code>). The four engines in the onboarding picker — Tiny, Small, Medium, and Large turbo — are multilingual and work with every language above. If your model setting shows an id ending in <code>.en</code>, it will not transcribe other languages properly. Re-pick an engine in <a href="models.html">Settings ▸ Transcription</a> and the pairing takes care of itself.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="quality">Accuracy outside English</h2>
        <p>Whisper's quality varies by language, and the gap between model sizes widens considerably away from English. As models get smaller they effectively become English specialists. Practical guidance:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>For non-English dictation, run the <strong>largest model your Mac handles comfortably</strong> before tuning anything else.</li>
          <li>Widely represented languages (Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Italian) do well. Languages with less training data are more variable.</li>
          <li>The <a href="dictionary.html">personal dictionary</a> works in any language and is the fix for names regardless.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="switching">Switching languages</h2>
        <p>The language setting is a single global choice, not per-app or automatic. Change it in Settings when you switch languages. There is no mixed-language mode: dictate one language per take for best results.</p>

        <h2 id="cleanup">Cleanup and language</h2>
        <p>If you use <a href="ai-cleanup.html">AI cleanup</a>, the model you point it at also needs to handle your language well. Cleanup is instructed to preserve meaning and return only the cleaned text, so a model weak in your language may do more harm than good. When in doubt in a non-English language, leaving cleanup off and taking the raw Whisper transcript is often the better result.</p>

    "body": """
        <h2 id="mic">1. Fix the microphone situation</h2>
        <p>This is the biggest single factor and the most overlooked. A MacBook's built-in microphone is decent at conversational distance and poor across a room. If you are leaning back from an open laptop, the mic is largely hearing your ceiling.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sit at a normal working distance, or use a headset — AirPods or any wired headset mic beat a built-in array at distance.</li>
          <li>Reduce steady background noise where you can: fans, air conditioning, a nearby TV.</li>
          <li>Check that macOS is using the input you think it is, in <strong>System Settings ▸ Sound ▸ Input</strong>. Bluetooth headsets sometimes select a low-quality input profile.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="speak">2. Speak in phrases</h2>
        <p>Whisper resolves ambiguity from surrounding words. Delivering a complete clause at a natural pace gives it that context; word-by-word delivery removes it and makes the model <em>less</em> accurate, not more.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Speak as if to a colleague, not as if to a machine.</li>
          <li>Do not over-enunciate — unnatural stress patterns hurt.</li>
          <li>Hold the key a beat before you start and a beat after you finish, so the first and last words are not clipped.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="dictionary">3. Teach it your vocabulary</h2>
        <p>Proper nouns are not a model-size problem — a name absent from training data stays absent at every size. The <a href="dictionary.html">personal dictionary</a> is the durable fix for colleagues' names, product names, and internal jargon.</p>
        <div class="callout warn">
          <span class="callout-label">Important caveat</span>
          <p>The dictionary and the <a href="profile.html">Know-Me profile</a> are applied during <a href="ai-cleanup.html">AI cleanup</a>. With cleanup set to <strong>None</strong>, they have no effect on your output. If you rely on them, cleanup needs to be on.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="model">4. Move up a model size</h2>
        <p>If the first three did not get you there, try the next model up in <a href="models.html">Settings ▸ Transcription</a>. The jump matters most for accented speech, noisy rooms, and non-English languages. On Apple Silicon, Large turbo is usually worth it.</p>

        <h2 id="cleanup">5. Turn on cleanup for prose</h2>
        <p>Raw transcripts contain your filler words and false starts because that is what you said. If you are dictating email or documents rather than notes, <a href="ai-cleanup.html">AI cleanup</a> removes the &ldquo;um&rdquo;s, fixes grammar, and handles spoken corrections like &ldquo;no wait, I mean&rdquo;. It also activates your dictionary and profile.</p>

        <h2 id="expectations">What accuracy to expect</h2>
        <p>We do not publish a benchmark, because word error rate depends on your microphone, accent, vocabulary, and room far more than on anything we could measure in a lab. The honest test is the one you can run in a minute: dictate a real paragraph of your own work and judge the result. If it disappoints, work down this page in order — the fix is nearly always here.</p>

          <p>The dictionary is applied during <a href="ai-cleanup.html">AI cleanup</a>. With cleanup set to <strong>None</strong> — the shipping default — your entries have <strong>no effect</strong>, because there is no stage in which to apply them. If the dictionary is why you want the feature, turn cleanup on.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="adding">Adding words</h2>
        <p>Open <strong>Dashboard ▸ Personalize</strong> and type the word as it should be spelled, then press add. Entries are stored immediately.</p>
        <p>Good candidates:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Colleagues' and clients' names, especially non-English spellings.</li>
          <li>Product and project names — yours and your customers'.</li>
          <li>Technical terms and command names: <code>kubectl</code>, <code>WhisperKit</code>, <code>TestFlight</code>.</li>
          <li>Anything you have corrected by hand more than twice.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There is no cap on entries, but a focused list works better than an exhaustive one — every entry is context the cleanup model has to weigh.</p>

        <h2 id="how">How entries are applied</h2>
        <p>The dictionary is not a find-and-replace pass. Your words are supplied to the cleanup model as explicit instructions — roughly &ldquo;always use these exact spellings&rdquo; followed by your list — so the model corrects a misheard variant in context rather than blindly substituting text. That is why an entry can fix a name even when Whisper produced something only loosely similar.</p>
        <p>Entries may also carry <strong>aliases</strong>: known mishearings of the word, which are passed along as &ldquo;may be misheard as…&rdquo;. Aliases are shown in the dictionary list when present. The Know-Me interview seeds some entries automatically from the names and jargon you provide.</p>

        <h2 id="duplicates">Duplicates and editing</h2>
        <p>Adding a word that already exists (ignoring case) merges into the existing entry rather than creating a second one. To remove an entry, use the delete control on its row.</p>

        <h2 id="storage">Where it is stored</h2>
        <p><code>~/Library/Application Support/OpenVoiceFlow/dictionary.json</code>, written with file protection on every change. It never leaves your Mac except as part of the cleanup prompt, and then only to the provider you chose. See <a href="privacy-architecture.html">Privacy architecture</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="seeding">Seeding from your profile</h2>
        <p>Running the <a href="profile.html">Know-Me interview</a> adds the names and technical terms you list into the dictionary automatically, without overwriting entries you added yourself. It is the fastest way to populate a useful starting set.</p>

    "body": """
        <h2 id="what">What a snippet is</h2>
        <p>A snippet pairs a spoken <strong>trigger</strong> with an <strong>expansion</strong>. Say the trigger and nothing else, and the expansion is inserted verbatim.</p>
        <p>Common uses: your email signature, your address, a standup preamble, a bug-report template, a legal disclaimer, a support reply you send daily.</p>

        <h2 id="creating">Creating one</h2>
        <p>The Snippets tab in <strong>Dashboard ▸ Personalize</strong> has two fields — trigger and expansion. Keep triggers short and distinctive: <code>my address</code>, <code>signature</code>, <code>standup intro</code>. Triggers are stored lowercase and matched case-insensitively, so you do not need to worry about how you capitalize them.</p>
        <p>Adding a trigger that already exists replaces its expansion, which makes editing a snippet as simple as re-adding it.</p>

        <h2 id="matching">How matching works</h2>
        <p>After transcription, the app compares what you said against your triggers:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>An <strong>exact match</strong> of the whole transcript expands.</li>
          <li>A <strong>prefix match</strong> also expands, provided the trigger ends at a word boundary — so &ldquo;signature&rdquo; matches but &ldquo;signatures&rdquo; does not accidentally fire it.</li>
          <li>When several triggers could match, the longest one wins.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Say a trigger in the middle of a longer sentence and it will <em>not</em> expand — snippets are deliberately an all-or-nothing gesture, so ordinary dictation never mutates unexpectedly.</p>

        <div class="callout tip">
          <span class="callout-label">Snippets skip cleanup entirely</span>
          <p>When a trigger matches, the expansion is inserted immediately and no cleanup call is made — not even when cleanup is enabled. Your expansion arrives exactly as you wrote it, with no model rewriting it, and with no network request. It is the fastest path through the app.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="storage">Where they are stored</h2>
        <p><code>~/Library/Application Support/OpenVoiceFlow/snippets.json</code>. There is no cap on how many you can have, and they are never uploaded.</p>

        <h2 id="tips">Choosing good triggers</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Two or three words beats one — single common words risk firing when you meant to dictate them.</li>
          <li>Avoid triggers that are also natural sentence openings.</li>
          <li>Say the trigger cleanly and stop. Trailing &ldquo;um&rdquo; can prevent a match.</li>
          <li>If a snippet is not firing, check <a href="dashboard.html">History</a> to see exactly what was transcribed — usually the transcript differs slightly from the trigger you registered.</li>

        <p>With cleanup off, the pipeline makes no network request at all and OpenVoiceFlow works entirely offline. With it on, you also activate your <a href="dictionary.html">dictionary</a>, <a href="profile.html">profile</a>, and <a href="styles.html">per-app styles</a>, all of which are applied at this stage.</p>

        <h2 id="sent">Exactly what is sent</h2>

        <h2 id="failure">When it fails</h2>
        <p>Cleanup fails open, always. If the API key is missing, the provider returns an error, the request times out (10 seconds for cloud providers, 120 for local Ollama), or the response cannot be parsed, OpenVoiceFlow inserts your <strong>raw on-device transcript</strong> instead.</p>
        <p>The practical consequence is that a cleanup outage costs you polish, never words. It also means that if cleanup silently seems to stop working, the thing to check is your <a href="api-keys.html">API key and credit balance</a> — the app will keep quietly giving you raw transcripts.</p>

          <li>Pull a small instruct model — a 3B-class model is plenty for tidying text.</li>
          <li>In <strong>Settings ▸ AI cleanup</strong>, choose <strong>Ollama</strong>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>OpenVoiceFlow talks to Ollama at <code>localhost:11434</code>, and allows a longer timeout (120 seconds) than for cloud providers, since local generation on a busy machine can be slower. If Ollama is not running, cleanup fails open and you get the raw transcript.</p>
        <div class="callout tip">
          <span class="callout-label">The best of both</span>
          <p>Cleanup is a dropdown, not a commitment. Plenty of people run Ollama on the road and a cloud provider at their desk.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="cloud">Cloud providers</h2>
        <p>Each backend uses that provider's standard API endpoint with a sensible default model. You can override the model per backend with the <strong>model override</strong> field in Settings if you prefer a specific one — leave it empty to use the default.</p>
        <p>Since cleanup is a short, simple rewriting task, the cheapest small model from any provider generally does it well. Reaching for a frontier model here mostly buys you latency.</p>

        <h2 id="latency">What to expect on speed</h2>
        <p>Cleanup adds a step between releasing the key and seeing text. Cloud providers are typically fast enough to feel immediate, with Groq marketed specifically on latency. Local Ollama depends entirely on your Mac and chosen model — a small model on Apple Silicon is comfortable; a large one on a busy Intel Mac is not.</p>
        <p>If cleanup ever feels slow, remember the 10-second cloud timeout: past that, the app gives you the raw transcript rather than making you wait.</p>

        <h2 id="switching">Switching backends</h2>
        <p>Change it any time from <strong>Settings ▸ AI cleanup</strong> or the menu-bar <strong>Cleanup</strong> submenu. Each backend keeps its own key in the Keychain, so switching back and forth does not require re-entering anything. Next steps: <a href="api-keys.html">API keys &amp; costs</a>.</p>

    "body": """
        <h2 id="adding">Adding a key</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Create an API key in your provider's console (OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI, or Groq).</li>
          <li>In OpenVoiceFlow, open <strong>Dashboard ▸ Settings ▸ AI cleanup</strong>.</li>
          <li>Select the provider and paste the key into its field.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The key is saved to your Keychain as soon as you enter it. Each backend stores its own key, so you can configure several and switch freely.</p>

        <h2 id="storage">Where keys are stored</h2>
        <p>In the <strong>macOS Keychain</strong>, as generic passwords under the service <code>app.openvoiceflow.apikeys</code>, marked accessible only after the first unlock of your Mac. They are never written to the settings file or any plain-text file on disk, and never included in history or logs.</p>
        <p>You can inspect or delete them yourself in <strong>Keychain Access</strong> by searching for that service name.</p>

        <h2 id="cost">What it costs</h2>
        <p>A cleanup request is small: your transcript plus a short instruction and your personal context, returning about the same length of text. In practical terms this is one of the cheapest possible API workloads — most people dictating all day land in the range of cents per month on a small model, not dollars.</p>
        <p>We deliberately do not print per-token prices here, because providers change them and a stale number in documentation is worse than none. Check your provider's current pricing page, and note that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Small and &ldquo;mini&rdquo;-class models are entirely adequate for this task.</li>
          <li>Longer dictations cost proportionally more, but they are still short by API standards.</li>
          <li>A large <a href="dictionary.html">dictionary</a> and <a href="profile.html">profile</a> add context to every request — another reason to keep them focused.</li>
          <li><a href="backends.html">Ollama</a> costs nothing at all.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="revoking">Revoking and rotating</h2>
        <p>To stop using a key, clear the field in Settings, or delete the entry in Keychain Access, or revoke it in your provider's console — any of the three works, and revoking at the provider is the one that is definitive if you believe a key was exposed.</p>
        <p>Switching cleanup to <strong>None</strong> stops all outbound cleanup requests immediately, whether or not a key is still stored.</p>

        <div class="callout warn">
          <span class="callout-label">If cleanup quietly stops improving your text</span>
          <p>Because cleanup <a href="ai-cleanup.html">fails open</a>, an expired key, an exhausted balance, or a rate limit shows up as raw transcripts rather than an error message. If your output suddenly reads like exactly what you said, check your provider's dashboard first.</p>

        <h2 id="analytics">Analytics &amp; leaderboard</h2>
        <p>Since <strong>0.5.7</strong>, the app can share an anonymous usage summary to power an in-app leaderboard ranked by time saved. This is a real change from earlier versions, which sent nothing — it's on by default, and this section says exactly what that means.</p>
        <p><strong>Turning it off:</strong> Settings ▸ Privacy ▸ <em>&ldquo;Share anonymous usage &amp; leaderboard rank&rdquo;</em>. Off stops every request in the row above; nothing is cached to send later.</p>
        <p><strong>What's sent, when it's on:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>A random device ID generated for this installation (not tied to your Apple ID, email, or any account — there is no account) and a display name you can change, shown to other users on the leaderboard. Installations remain separate even when they use the same nickname, so three computers produce three independent rows.</li>
          <li>Aggregate counters already shown on your Home pane: total words dictated, total time saved, your streak, and which features are on (cleanup enabled, snippet/dictionary counts, whether you've run Know-Me) — counts only, never contents.</li>
          <li>Your country, derived server-side from the request at the moment it arrives. Your IP address itself is never logged or stored.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Aggregate totals sync periodically during active dictation. Changing a nickname sends the same aggregate snapshot once when you press Return or leave the field, then refreshes the leaderboard; individual keystrokes are not uploaded.</p>
        <p><strong>What's never sent, whether or not this is on:</strong> dictated text, snippets, dictionary entries, Know-Me profile content, or anything from the cleanup path. Those stay exactly as described in the rest of this page.</p>
        <p>The leaderboard itself never discloses how many people use OpenVoiceFlow in total — only ranks and time-saved figures for the people shown.</p>

        <h2 id="never">What is never collected</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No dictation content, ever.</strong> Not your words, not your audio — the usage summary above is aggregate counts only.</li>
          <li><strong>No account.</strong> Nothing to sign up for. The device ID above identifies one app installation, not a person; installations are never merged by nickname.</li>
          <li><strong>No precise location.</strong> Country-level only, derived at request time; no IP address is stored.</li>
          <li><strong>No screen reading.</strong> Accessibility permission is used only to send a paste keystroke.</li>

        <p>Two checks anyone can run:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Airplane mode.</strong> Turn off Wi-Fi with cleanup set to None and dictate. It works, because dictation itself never needs a network — the usage sync above is fire-and-forget and never blocks it.</li>
          <li><strong>Network monitor.</strong> Run Little Snitch or similar and watch. With cleanup off and usage sharing off, dictation generates no connections at all. With usage sharing on (the default), you'll see the occasional request described in the table above, and nothing else.</li>

    "body": """
        <h2 id="how">How updating works</h2>
        <p>OpenVoiceFlow uses <strong>Sparkle</strong>, the standard update framework for Mac apps distributed outside the App Store. With automatic updates on, it checks a signed feed hosted on openvoiceflow.com at launch and roughly once a day, downloads any newer version in the background, and installs it the next time you launch the app.</p>

        <h2 id="security">How updates are verified</h2>
        <p>Two independent checks must pass before anything installs:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>EdDSA signature.</strong> Every update is signed with a private key held by the maintainers, and each shipped app pins the matching public key. An update that is not signed with that exact key is rejected.</li>
          <li><strong>Apple notarization.</strong> The downloaded build must carry a valid Developer-ID signature and Apple notarization.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is why the update path is safe to leave on: an attacker who compromised the download would still need the signing key, which never leaves the maintainers' control.</p>

        <h2 id="manual">Updating manually</h2>
        <p>Choose <strong>Check for Updates…</strong> from the menu-bar menu, or use <strong>Check for updates now</strong> in <strong>Dashboard ▸ Settings</strong>. If a newer version exists you will be shown what changed before anything installs.</p>

        <h2 id="turnoff">Turning automatic updates off</h2>
        <p><strong>Dashboard ▸ Settings ▸ Automatic updates</strong>. With it off, no background checks are made and no update downloads — you can still check manually at any time.</p>
        <div class="callout tip">
          <span class="callout-label">A reason to leave it on</span>
          <p>Even with usage sharing on, the anonymous summary doesn't tell us who's on an old build in any actionable way — there's no way to reach a specific device. Automatic updates are how a fix for something like a broken model download actually reaches you.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="version">Checking your version</h2>
        <p>The dashboard sidebar footer shows your version, marked <em>auto-updating</em> when background checks are on. <strong>Settings</strong> shows it too, alongside the manual check button. This documentation describes <strong>0.5.16</strong>.</p>

        <h2 id="downgrade">Reinstalling or going back</h2>
        <p>To reinstall, download the current DMG from the <a href="%s">download page</a> and replace the copy in Applications; your settings, history, and personalization are stored separately and survive. There is no supported downgrade path — older builds are not hosted, and installing one would disable the fixes that came after it.</p>

          <li><strong>Delete the app:</strong> drag <code>/Applications/OpenVoiceFlow.app</code> to the Trash. This also removes the login item.</li>
          <li><strong>Delete your data:</strong> remove <code>~/Library/Application Support/OpenVoiceFlow/</code> — settings, history, dictionary, snippets, styles, and profile.</li>
          <li><strong>Delete the speech models</strong> (the big one): remove <code>~/Documents/huggingface/models/argmaxinc/whisperkit-coreml/</code>. Models are up to 1.6 GB each.</li>
          <li><strong>Remove API keys</strong> (only if you used cloud cleanup): open <strong>Keychain Access</strong>, search for <code>app.openvoiceflow.apikeys</code>, and delete the entries.</li>
          <li><strong>Revoke permissions</strong> (optional): in <strong>System Settings ▸ Privacy &amp; Security</strong>, remove OpenVoiceFlow from Microphone, Accessibility, and Input Monitoring.</li>

          <span class="callout-label">Just want the disk space back?</span>
          <p>Step 4 alone recovers nearly all of it. If you switch models occasionally, that folder may hold several — deleting it is safe, and the app re-downloads whichever model you select next.</p>

        <h2 id="keep">Clearing your data but keeping the app</h2>
        <p>You do not have to uninstall to reset. <strong>Dashboard ▸ Settings ▸ Delete history…</strong> clears your transcripts, with an option to keep your first-ever dictation. <strong>Know-Me ▸ Clear</strong> empties your profile. Dictionary and snippet entries can be deleted individually from the Personalize pane.</p>

        <h2 id="reinstall">Reinstalling later</h2>
        <p>If you leave the Application Support folder in place, reinstalling picks up exactly where you left off — same settings, same history, same dictionary. Remove that folder first if you want a genuinely clean start.</p>

        <h2 id="feedback">Before you go</h2>
        <p>If something drove you to uninstall, we would genuinely like to know which thing it was — <a href="mailto:shimoverse@gmail.com">shimoverse@gmail.com</a>. The project is free and has no retention metrics, so an email is the only way that signal reaches anyone.</p>

PAGES["faq"] = {
    "head_title": "OpenVoiceFlow FAQ — Free Voice Dictation for macOS",
    "title": "FAQ",
    "description": "Frequently asked questions about OpenVoiceFlow: whether it is really free, how private it is, offline use, accuracy, supported Macs, languages, and how it compares to alternatives.",
    "lede": "Short answers to what we get asked most. Longer versions link through to the relevant page.",
    "faq": [
        ("Is OpenVoiceFlow really free?",
         "Yes. It is MIT-licensed, has no paid tier, no account, and no trial period. Your Mac provides the compute, so there is nothing to charge you for. If you enable optional cloud cleanup you pay your chosen AI provider directly for tokens — typically cents per month — and nothing to us."),
        ("Does my voice leave my Mac?",
         "No. Audio is transcribed on-device by Whisper and discarded once text exists. There is no code path that uploads audio. If you turn on cloud AI cleanup, the resulting text is sent to the provider you chose under your own key; choosing Ollama or leaving cleanup off keeps everything local."),
        ("Does it work offline?",
         "Yes. After the one-time model download, dictation works in airplane mode — the usage-sharing sync (if you've left it on) is fire-and-forget and never blocks it. With cleanup and usage sharing both off, no network request is made at any point."),
        ("Which Macs are supported?",
         "macOS 14 Sonoma or newer, on both Apple Silicon and Intel. One universal build covers both. For macOS 12 to 13 a retained 0.3.6 Apple Silicon build is available, but it is end-of-life."),
        ("Is there a Windows, Linux, iPhone, or Android version?",
         "Not today. OpenVoiceFlow is macOS-only. iOS and Android versions are in development but cannot be downloaded yet."),
        ("How accurate is it?",
         "That depends on your microphone, accent, vocabulary, and model choice far more than on anything we could benchmark. Whisper's larger models are widely regarded as excellent. The honest test takes a minute: dictate a real paragraph of your own work and judge the result."),
        ("Can I say punctuation out loud?",
         "Not in version 0.5.16 — saying 'comma' produces the word 'comma'. Whisper punctuates from sentence structure automatically, and optional AI cleanup fixes grammar and removes filler words if you want more."),
        ("Why is my dictionary not working?",
         "The personal dictionary, Know-Me profile, and per-app styles are all applied during AI cleanup. With cleanup set to None, which is the default, they have no effect. Turn cleanup on, or use local Ollama if you want that behaviour without sending text to a cloud."),
        ("Which languages does it support?",
         "All 99 languages in Whisper's multilingual set, including Ukrainian, Arabic, Hindi, and Chinese — see the full list on the <a href=\"languages.html\">Languages</a> page. Accuracy outside English depends heavily on model size, so use the largest model your Mac handles comfortably."),
        ("What happens if the AI cleanup service fails?",
         "You get your raw transcript. Cleanup is designed to fail open: on a missing key, an error, a timeout, or an unparseable response, the app inserts the on-device transcription rather than losing your words."),
        ("Does it collect any analytics?",
         "As of 0.5.7, yes, and it's on by default: an anonymous usage summary (word/time totals, which features you use, your country, and a display name you choose) powers an in-app leaderboard. Never audio, never dictated text, never anything from your dictionary, snippets, or Know-Me profile. Turn it off in Settings ▸ Privacy ▸ \"Share anonymous usage & leaderboard rank\" — full detail in Privacy architecture's Analytics & leaderboard section. The website separately uses privacy-friendly anonymous page-view analytics, unrelated to the app."),
        ("How do I get support?",
         "Use the Feedback item in the dashboard sidebar, or email shimoverse@gmail.com. Include your macOS version, your Mac's chip, your OpenVoiceFlow version, and what you saw versus what you expected — the usage summary is aggregate counts, not diagnostics, so your description is still what gets things fixed."),
        ("Can I use OpenVoiceFlow at work with confidential material?",
         "The architecture is designed for exactly that case: audio never leaves the machine, and with cleanup off or pointed at local Ollama, neither does text. Your organization's own policy still applies, and the source being open means your security team can verify the claims rather than trust them."),
        ("Can I use the code in my own project?",
         "Yes — it is MIT-licensed and free for any use. Keep the credit visible, and we would genuinely like to hear about it at shimoverse@gmail.com."),

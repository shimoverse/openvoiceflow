"""SEO/AEO contracts for the public website.

The blog exists to bring search and AI-assistant traffic to the site. Each
test here pins the plumbing that quietly breaks that goal when a page is
added or edited: a missing canonical splits ranking signal across URL
variants, a page absent from the sitemap can go unindexed for weeks, an
article without analytics is invisible in the numbers, and a broken
llms.txt link teaches AI assistants to cite 404s. None of these failures
are visible on the rendered page — which is exactly why they're tests.
